# threewinchecker

Overview
--------

There is a saying in volleyball: "Who doesn't win 3:0, loses 2:3". This project
consists of two executables aimed at checking that proverb.

* scraper - downloads and scrapes match results from
  [http://www.worldofvolley.com](http://www.worldofvolley.com )
  website and saves them to a CSV file.

* checker - uses a CSV file generated by scraper to calculate the fraction of
  matches satisfying the proverb. That is the number of matches lost 2:3 divided
  by matches in which the first two sets were won.

After analyzing almost 4,000 matches from 2013-2015 it turns out only 17% of
matches are lost after losing a 2-set streak. The proverb is most likely false.
